# Snowymaul Wars

Snowymaul Wars is heavily inspired by the Warcraft III map Wintermaul Wars which I played countless hours as a kid.

Wintermaul Wars was itself a spin-off of the popular tower defense (TD) Wintermaul TD or just Wintermaul for short. 

Wintermaul was a tower defense where mobs spawned at different pools across the map, each one corresponding to a particular player, but instead of walking a pre-defined path, the player used the towers themselves to create a maze and make the least efficient path possible for the mobs to walk in order to maximize damage. Any mobs that "leaked" from a player could be caught by another player on the team that was closer to the end objective, which was a ship at the bottom of the map.

Wintermaul Wars was a natural extension of this TD, where instead of the mobs spawning naturally in pre-defined waves, an opposing team on the other side of the map could send mobs with their own gold. Sending mobs also increased your passive income, so there were various strategies on how to maximize gold income for late game or try to beat your opponent by going for early hard-to-deal-with sends.

I hope the capture the essense of that and put it into a simple little standalone game that others who never played WMW could enjoy :)
